# Proof of Concept

Mousemove reacting and animated background without JS

# How it works

Catch mouse move with labels (translate respective hover state to inputs)

Input change svg on background via `~` CSS selector

CSS change color of svg via SASS variables depending on row and column of hovered block (SASS)

Some prepared SVG paths assigned via SASS depending of hovered block (works only in chomium)

# TODO

Generate some paths, to smooth animation between SVG paths

Update SVG paths so the points fill whole screen (try to move mouse at corner)

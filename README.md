# Proof of Concept

Mousemove reacting and animated background without JS

# How it works

Catch mouse move with labels (translate respective hover state to inputs)

Input change svg on background via `~` CSS selector

CSS change color of svg via SASS variables depending on row and column of hovered block (SASS)

Some prepared SVG paths assigned via SASS depending of hovered block

# TODO

Generate some paths, to smooth animation between SVG paths
